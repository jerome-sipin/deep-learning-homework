This is my (Jerome Sipin) submission for the deep learning homework.

This was a bit tough since I was on a trip and was absent for the first half of
the unit.

The original code can be found in 'AlphabetSoupCharity Original Model.ipynb',
while my attempted optimizations can be found in 'AlphabetSoupCharity Optimizations.ipynb'.
The associated models use the same name.

The report can be found in 'Report.txt'.
