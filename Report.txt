Data Preprocessing:
Targets: Successful
Features: Application type and classification primarily, and the other non EIN/Name columns
Non-features to be removed: EIN and Name columns


Compiling, Training, Evaluating:
For the first run, I used all of the suggested parameters for the model (such as layers, or neurons), as
they were provided in the starter code.

For the second run, I tried to (1) drop less columns from both the application types
and classifications, (2) use less neurons, but more layers, (3) use a different optimizer during
compilation, and (4) use less epochs. I did these because I felt that if there was more data to use,
but less trials, then there would be more chances of getting the desired result. However, no matter
what I tried, the result only changed slightly.
